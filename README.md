# AppleContacts

My name is DK. This app is contacts for the tablet PC.
I am working on different my own projects.
I am still working on this app and will soon update and finalize it.

TO USE:
On the left hand side, tap your finger on the name. Then, you will see
the user information on the right hand side.

WHAT TO UPDATE:
* I did not use frame activity on this app so will update with the fragment layout.
* You can find user name by typing first name of the user on the prompt.
* Listview will populate only user names you wna to find. But, I want to design this
  sightly differently. I want to search user names letter by letter. I will work on this
  and will update.
* This app contains drawble image view but currently there is no images. I will work on this
  and will update.
  
  Please let me know if you have any questions or you can give me some advice.
